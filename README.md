### Hello !! 🖖🏾✌🏾 I’m Xavier! 

Hello !🖖🏾✌🏾 I’m Xavier! I am an aspiring full-stack software engineer, currently enrolled in the Pursuit Fellowship program, a Google-funded 12-month intensive software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate headquartered in Long Island City, NY. 

At Pursuit, I'm learning how to create web applications with technologies like React, JavaScript (ES6), HTML5, CSS3, Express, PostgreSQL, APIs, and Git.

An avid and experienced storyteller and professional creative with a background in storytelling and community engagement,  I'm excited to learn new ways of growing and engaging new audiences.  I love gathering people together and sharing stories. Learning about each other; seeking common ground and sharing goals.

I’m a proud nerd, a huge gamer and I'd love to have join me in a D&D Adventure!
